# Prerequisites

## ThunderClient
Tool used to test API clients. Can install in vsCode

## Npm packages installation
Since package.json and package-lock.json already in repository, install npm i nodeman -g to get dependencies.

## JWT Authentification
Need to create an Access and Refresh Token for client API. in order to do so:
 1) install `npm i dotenv jsonwebtoken cookie-parser`
 2) Create variables ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET and REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET in .env file
 3) Type 'node' in terminal
 4) Type `require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'). Copy output (without quotes) and paste it into ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET variable
 5) run line again and copy output into REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET

## Mongodb
Create a mongoDb account and create a table using this link: https://www.mongodb.com/basics/create-database
Connect your database to your application by:
  1) Pressing 'connect' button on your database deployment page, then click "Connect your applicaatoin" option and follow instructions
  2) Create a  '.env' file in your project diretory (will use later) and create variable DATABASE_URI = mongodb+srv://<projectname>:            <password>@cluster0.szw7tux.mongodb.net/<database>?retryWrites=true&w=majority. This
 
  
 
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
